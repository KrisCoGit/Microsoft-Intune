# Microsoft Intune

  

This is a collection of Intune configuration profiles.

## Configuration Profiles: 

  

When working with config profiles, be sure you consider any specific settings for your institution. For example, if you blacklist all browser extensions, be sure to whitelist or force install business critical browser extensions. 

  

## CIS Benchmark Profiles:

  

Before implementing benchmarked profiles for devices, be certain to review all implications.  For example, a CIS L2 BitLocker setting may break Autopilot resets.  Remember, it’s a process, not a switch to flip.
